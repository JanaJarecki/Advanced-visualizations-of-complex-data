# Data Visualization and Quantitative Information Design

Since 2012, I've been fascinated by the power of clear visuals, whether untangling complex ML model outputs or illustrating simple data stories.

Turning data into understanding has been my jam since 2012. Whether it's teasing out model nuances with clear comparisons or simply illustrating timelines, I get a kick out of effective data visualization.


You'll find my visualizations are code-first, which means they're agile and ready to update as the data evolves. I bring my cognitive science background to this - understanding what makes a graph work for people based on evidence on how we read visuals (like research by [Garcia-Retamero et al, 2017](https://oxfordre.com/communication/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-302)) and making sure they're accessible (color-blind friendly, [Birch, 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22472762/)).

My approach leans on strong quantitative data design fundamentals: the grammar of graphics ([Wilkinson, 2005](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0)) and is informed by elegant graphic-design principles, like informative grid layouts.

Why all this effort? Because I believe that well-crafted visuals are a (the?) key to understanding complexity.
